# Twitter-sentimental-analysis


Detailed sentiment analysis of tweets based on ordinal regression using machine learning techniques. 
The proposed approach consists of first pre-processing tweets and using a feature extraction method that creates an efficient feature. 
Then, under several classes, these features scoring and balancing. Multinomial logistic regression (SoftMax), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Trees (DTs), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms are used for sentiment analysis classification in the proposed framework. 

Create a dataset and classify them into positive tweets,negative tweets.
